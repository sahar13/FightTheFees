        <h1>Who's in charge?</h1>
        <p>The provincial government and federal government are both responsible for funding education and regulating tuition fees.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h3>The Government of Ontario</h3>
        <p>Despite the federal government's central role in post-secondary education, Canada remains the only major industrialized country without any national oversight over higher education. A national standard for post-secondary education would ensure that federal funding to our post-sedoncary institutions are succintly allocated and will eliminate the disparty in funding amongst all the provinces.<p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h3>The Government of Canada</h3>
        <p>The provincial government meanwhile puts together a framework for campuses to follow through the Ministry of Advanced Education and Skills Development. The framework regulates tuition fee increases, which currently allow public universities to increase fees by three to five per cent each year for domestic students. There is no limit to international student tuition fee increases in place, so institutions can use them as cash cows.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h3>Did you know...?</h3>
        <p>The provincial government and the federal government can put a stop to tuition fee increases and growing student debt. Earlier this year, the provincial government created the Ontario Student Grant, which covers a significant portion, if not all of the cost of education for students coming from low income families. The Government of Ontario achieved this simply by reallocating the funds from existing convoluted, inaccessible and ineffective programs, like the 30% Off Ontario Student Grant. Imagine what the federal government and provincial government could do if they invested in education and made a continuous and strong commitment to provide more money for our education system, thereby ensuring that students and their families are not forced to cover budgetary shortfalls through tuition fee increases.</p>
      </section>

    <section>
      <h1 class="article">What's wrong?</h1>
      <p>Decades of underfunding has created a crisis in post-secondary education. Our institutions are less and less publicly funded, and rely increasingly on students and their families to operate.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h3>Tuition Fees</h3>
      <p>Dramatic tuition fee increases have been the direct result of cuts to public funding for post-secondary education by the federal and provincial governments. In the past 25 years, average tuition fees in Canada have increased by more than 137%. An educated community benefits everyone, yet our governments and institutions have attempted to reframe post-secondary education as an individual good, and shifted the responsibility of paying for it onto students. Today, 60% of Canada's post-secondary students come from the two highest income quartiles. Education is a right for us all, not aprivilege of a few.<p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h3>Student Debt</h3>
      <p>Rising tuition fees and the prevalende of loan-based financial assistance have pushed student debt to historic levels. Today, students graduate with over $28,000 of education-related debt after an undergraduate degree. The amount owed to the Canada Student Loan Program is increasing by nearly $1 million per day. By fall 2016, students will owe the federal government over $19 billion. Low- and middle-income students who are forced to take out stuent loans end up paying more for their education because they must pay both tuition fees and the accumulated interest on their student loans. With insurmountable levels of student debt, our provindial and federal governments are preventing an entire generation of Canadians from having a fair chance at a decent living after graduating.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h3>Funding Cuts</h3>
      <p>Public funding currently accounts for less than 49% of university and college operating funds, down from 77% just 20 years ago. In recent decades, various governments have made the political choices to claw back public funding for post-secondary education and download costs onto students through tuition fees. This constitutes a strategic re-orientation of Canada's post-secondary education system away from a publicly funded model and towards a privatized user fee system. Public education is a public good that society benefits from as a whole and it must be funded as such.</p>

      <h1 class="article">What can students do?</h1>
    </section>
    <section class="section">
      <p>Students have been mobilizing for years in response to increasing tuition fees, skyrocketing student debt and government funding cuts.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <p>We have been building awareness amongst students and their families on the importance of public services and the risks of privatizing some of our most crucial services such as education. In response to this growing crisis, we are escalating our campaign to demand the elimination of university and college tuition fees across the country.<p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <p>A number of years ago, the labour movement fought for and won free public schooling from Kindergarten to Grade 12. In many ways, college and university has become the new high school, and we are inviting you to join us in fighting to extend free education from Kindergarten to the post-secondary level. <p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <p>At our Annual General Meeting in June, students from coast to coast voted to mobilize Canadaâ€™s student movement for a National Day of Action that will take place on Wednesday, November 2, 2016. Students will be out on the streets, calling for a national, universal, tuition-free system of public, post-secondary education.<p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <p>To support organizing for the campaign, fourteen volunteer action coalitions across the province have been created. Get involved in your regional coalition today!<p>
