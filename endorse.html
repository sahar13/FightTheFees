        <h1>Although organizing a campaign is not simply a list of tasks to check off a list, this six-step guide can serve as a helpful resource to get things started on your campus!</h1>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2 class="ftf">Step 1:</h2><h3>Building a team</h3>
        <p>Organizing a successful campaign relies on your ability to build a dedicated core team of organizers. Start by reaching out to your friends and classmates. These are people that are more likely to already want to support you. Then reach out to any natural allies on campus, for example student groups, progressive professors and active workers. Be sure to think outside of the box when building your team: be intentional about reaching out to diverse people to bring their ideas and strengthen the coalition.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2 class="ftf">Step 2:</h2>
        <h3>Mapping out your campaign</h3>
        <p>Mapping out a yearlong plan for campaign is the best way to make sure your team stays on track. Create a calendar and make sure to highlight any key dates (orientation weeks/administration meetings/supporters events) and set milestones for your campaign (goals for petition collection). You want to determine the best times to reach out to students on campus to help plan for actions on campus.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2 class="ftf">Step 3:</h2>
        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>Education is a necessary step in every good campaign. It is an ongoing process that is never really finished. When people understand an issue and know how the issue affects them and their communities, they are more likely to get involved and support your campaign. Get creative; use a variety of ways to get your message across on campus. You can use class talks, leafleting, tabling, presentations and workshops to name a few.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2 class="ftf">Step 4:</h2>
        <h3>Mobilizing students on campus</h3>
        <p>Mobilizing students on campus is important to show that your campaign has support, but it is also a useful tactic to gauge how successful your outreach has been. You should start to see a broadening cross-section of people getting excited by the issues, discussing the campaign and our demands, and figuring out how they can support in their own capacity. At this point, it is important that you start to find ways to keep them involved and excited for the possibility of accessible post-secondary education.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2 class="ftf">Step 5:</h2>
        <h2>Pressuring your administration and government</h2>
        <p>When you start to feel that groundswell of support on campus for the demands, it is time that you start to engage with decision makers. This can be done in a variety of ways. You can start with making demands of your administration to commit to supporting students demands of the province or commit to taking action for affordable education right on campus. You can also reach out to your Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) to sure up their support for our demands.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2 class="ftf">Step 6:</h2>
        <h2>Escalation</h2>
        <p>Are the decision makers you are reaching out to not committing to take action to support our demands? Sounds like itâ€™s time to turn up the heat and give them that extra push. Undertaking resistance to unfair political and social conditions is the rights of all individuals in a democratic society. Often decision makers need to be forced to respond to public concerns. We generally use direct action (rallies, boycotts, media stunts etc.) to get decision makers to commit. Mobilizing and organizing is hard work! It only looks easy when it is done well. If you need support taking action on your campus make sure to reach out to us!</p>
