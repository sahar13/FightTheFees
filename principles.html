        <h1>The <strong class="ftf">Fight the Fees</strong> campaign operates on the following principles:</h1>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Education is a Right</h2>
        <p>Education is a fundamental right of every person without distinction. We believe that universally accessible education will only be achieved once the financial barriers to obtaining that education are eliminated.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Public Education for the Public Good</h2>
        <p>An educated population is key to the social development of our province and of society. Mass public education strengthens our economy, enriches society and reduces social and economic inequality The cost of public post-secondary education must be shared by all of us through a progressive tax system, not a user-pay model of tuition fees. Our post-secondary institutions must be by the public, for the public-- not tailored to private interests.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Grants Not Loans</h2>
        <p>When students canâ€™t afford the up front cost of an education, they are forced to rely on loans to finance their education, which facilitates ballooning debt. The added costs of interest means that students on financial assistance often end up paying more for their post-secondary education than those who can pay the costs upfront. Students from lower income families, who are more likely to rely take out loans to finance their education, are penalized for being unable to cover the sticker costs of their education. By converting the provincial portion of OSAP into nonrepayable grants, the government can save students and their families the struggle of ballooning debt.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Universal Access to Education</h2>
        <p>Everyone must be given an equal opportunity to access college and university education. Post-secondary education is becoming out of each for students from low-income backgrounds who cannot afford the high upfront cost of tuition fees. In order to access higher education without the fear of incurring debt, students are calling for the outright elimination of tuition fees for all students and for grants that cover other costs of attendance, such as housing, food, textbooks and transportation.</p>
